Roberto Hirata Jr. (1964 - ) is married to Nina S. Tomita Hirata and they have two sons and one daughter. His education was entirely in public schools. He holds a degree in Physics (IF-USP) and a degree in Mathematics (IME-USP). During his undergrad's studies, he has participated of three scientific trainings: Diferential Topology (one year, under Prof. Dr. Paulo F. Leite), Computational Mathematics (one year, under Prof. Dr. Ciro Patarra) and Computing Day (two years, under Prof. Dr. Valdemar W. Setzer). Besides helping to shape the Computing Day, he has lead the software team to produce all the software for the activity, and is the coauthor of two publications related to the activity. He got a MSc degree in Computer Science (1997) under Prof. Dr. Junior Barrera for his work on morphological segmentation and fast algorithms for basic morphological operators. During his master's, he has participated in three Journal papers and some conference papers, participated in the Olivetti's project to build a hand written signature identifier and in the MMorph project, a software for Mathematical Morphology for Khoros and MATLAB. He has got a PhD degree in Computer Science (2001) also under Dr. Barrera for his work on Aperture operators, a theme that has generated several other international works. As part of his PhD's training, he has worked under Prof. Dr. Edward Russel Dougherty in the Texas A&M University during one year and 4 months. His last works during the PhD were related to bioinformatics. He has build a software to automatic segment microarray images and also a software to analyse microarray data; both works resulted in papers in Journals. After his PhD, he has been hired as a researcher and professor for the SENAC College of Computer Science and Technology where he co-lead the Computer Vision group (2 PhDs, 2 MSc and 3 MSc candidates). This group had a strong link to industry and gave consulting and short courses to partners as EMBRAER. His research is focused in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Besides his collaboration with Dr. Barrera's group, he is also worked in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Eduardo Jordao Neves in a group called Mathematical Analysis of Interacting Gene Expression Systems (MAIGES). This group cooperated mainly wiith Dr. Luis Fernando Lima Reis and their work had been cover of two editions of one of the most prestigious journal in Cancer research, besides several other journal and conference papers. His teaching experience started in 1986 for the Computing Day, he has teached for SENAC College of Computer Science and Technology and currentely is an associate professor for IME-USP.
